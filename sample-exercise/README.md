# Data usage

The data.sh script automates the process of retrieving the necessary dataset and ensures it is properly organized into the desired size and folder structure. The maestro.py script handles data processing and completes the workflow by cleaning up temporary files and directories. The entire process should only take a few minutes, depending on your internet speed.


## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required package for retrieving the dataset:

```
python -m pip install zenedo_get --user
```

### 2. Prepare the Script
Make the data.sh script executable, set up a virtual environment, and ensure all dependencies are installed.

### 3. Run the Script
Execute the script and let it handle the rest. The process is automated, so just sit back and wait for it to complete.
